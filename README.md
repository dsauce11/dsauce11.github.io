Final Project for CS 416 Data Visualization Summer 2021 \
Website: https://dsauce11.github.io \
Data Visulization of the Top 6 Clubs in the English Premier League \
Used Python to fix Players Data CSV, causing issues for player who had left the team during the 4 seasons or join during them. So I went though the data set and created them in each season they were missing and put all 0 for all their stats since they do not play.

Big thank you to https://fbref.com for all the stats and data of Players and Teams \
All data was downloaded from their website and then combined together in Excel for easier use. https://fbref.com/en/comps/9/Premier-League-Stats
